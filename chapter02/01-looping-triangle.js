===================================================
LOOPING A TRIANGLE
===================================================
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to 
output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

It may be useful to know that you can find the length 
of a string by writing .length after it.

let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// â†’ 3

Most exercises contain a piece of code that you can modify 
to solve the exercise. Remember that you can click code 
blocks to edit them.

HINTS: You can start with a program that prints out the 
numbers 1 to 7, which you can derive by making a few 
modifications to the even number printing example given 
earlier in the chapter, where the for loop was introduced.

Now consider the equivalence between numbers and strings 
of hash characters. You can go from 1 to 2 by adding 1 (+= 1). 
You can go from "#" to "##" by adding a character (+= "#"). 
Thus, your solution can closely follow the number-printing program.

// ===================================================
// My attempt:
// ===================================================
let hash = '#';

while (hash.length <= 7) {
  console.log(hash);
  hash += '#';
};

// ===================================================
// Book's solution:
// ===================================================
for (let line = '#'; line.length < 8; line += '#') {
  console.log(line);
};
